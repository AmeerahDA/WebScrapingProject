But nothing is ever quite what it seems with the collaborative clocks of L’Epée 1839 × MB&F.The minimalistic structure is composed of four elytra (that’s the technical word for a beetle’s protective wing covers) that not only open up, but can also swivel like a transformer to display the Orb in a variety of different positions. Placed on its saucer so it doesn’t roll away, it can be displayed completely closed or with one, two or three opened elytra. Alternatively, opening all four elytra allows to display the clock without the saucer.Powering this state-of-the-art clock is a beautiful L’Epée 1839 hour-striking movement with an eight-day power reserve. There are two barrels, one for the time and the other for the striking of the hours, wound separately. The hour mechanism doesn’t just chime the passage of the hour, but indicates the actual hour, like a church clock.

Medusa is a dual-configuration clock, housed in hand-blown Murano glass, that can be ceiling mounted or stood upon a desk.The central mass of Medusa is formed by a large transparent dome of hand-blown Murano glass that evokes the bell-shaped body of a mature jellyfish. Two rotating rings, one displaying the hours and the other displaying the minutes, are visible through the dome, and the time is read off a single fixed indicator that extends over the rings. Like a jellyfish glowing in the abyss, Medusa glows in the dark thanks to Super-LumiNova. A movement beats underneath the time indication, forming the pulsating heart of this mechanical creature.Medusa comes in three limited editions of 50 pieces, each in a different colour – blue, green and pink – chosen to reflect the natural hues of a jellyfish.",Limited edition of 50 pieces

Manual-winding: the double-depth square socket key sets time and winds movement",,"Octopod continues MB&F's exploration of aquatic themes with an eight-leg, eight-day clock inspired by cephalopods, marine chronometers and                         The Abyss – blending contemporary design with kinetic sculpture and a transparent sphere filled with precision horology.Conceived by MB&F and built by L’Epée 1839, Octopod stands or crouches thanks to its eight articulated legs. However, the real horological magic and mystery take place in Octopod's completely transparent spherical ‘head'.The first thing to notice is that Octopod's transparent sphere is gimballed in a similar way to traditional ship chronometers. The second thing is the pulsating escapement, regulating the clock's precision, located on its minute hand rather than the more usual position attached to stationary movement plates.Last but not least, there's the mystery of how Octopod's clockwork is suspended inside its crystalline sphere, so that it appears to be floating in space or water.

Created with L’Epée 1839, Melchior is not only an impressive kinetic robot which may remind you of your childhood dreams, but also an impeccably finished, 480-component mechanical table clock.Jumping hours and sweeping minutes on Melchior’s chest are displayed via discs bearing MB&F’s signature numerals, while a dial on Melchior’s abdomen is the power reserve indicator. And this robot’s self-sufficiency is to be admired, for the finely-finished, highly-visible movement boasts a power reserve of 40 days, thanks to five mainspring barrels which help make up Melchior’s rippling torso. The gatling gun on his left arm doubles as the winding and time setting key.", Unique piece for Only Watch 2015

Those who have followed MB&F for a while will already be familiar with his work. The flowing script you see on the Legacy Machines is made in Eddy Jaquet’s hand; it is the merest hint of his true artistic talent. MB&F founder Maximilian Büsser says, “We’ve worked with Eddy for years, but getting him to engrave names on movements is like playing Für Elise on a Stradivarius violin — you couldn’t imagine a more modest use of such an amazing gift.”The most memorable work of the Neuchatel-based Jaquet is characterised by the depth of its scope and ambition; it is classical in style and heroic in its execution of human figures. In a way, the uniting theme of these 8 Pièces Uniques was inevitable. Says Büsser, “We’re brainstorming around the table, and a theme that comes immediately to mind is the writing of Jules Verne, because I’m so into science fiction, and because the Legacy Machine collection that Eddy has been working on is basically the watch that I would have created if MB&F was founded 150 years ago.”", Piece unique

MB&F founder Maximilian Büsser says, “We’ve worked with Eddy for years, but getting him to engrave names on movements is like playing Für Elise on a Stradivarius violin — you couldn’t imagine a more modest use of such an amazing gift.”The most memorable work of the Neuchatel-based Jaquet is characterised by the depth of its scope and ambition; it is classical in style and heroic in its execution of human figures. In a way, the uniting theme of these 8 Pièces Uniques was inevitable. Says Büsser, “We’re brainstorming around the table, and a theme that comes immediately to mind is the writing of Jules Verne, because I’m so into science fiction, and because the Legacy Machine collection that Eddy has been working on is basically the watch that I would have created if MB&F was founded 150 years ago.”", Piece unique

The planetary differential sits proud of the surface, supported by a stunning double-arc mirror-polished bridge.

Superlative hand finishing throughout respecting 19th century style", Hours and minutes Planetary differential transmits the average rate of the two regulators to the single gear train.,"MB&F celebrates the pioneering works of past masters and complications with Legacy Machine No.2.Suspended high above the dial, the double “flying” balances are in fact the most visible parts of two fully independent regulating systems, each beating at its own rate. The planetary differential sits proud of the surface, supported by a stunning double-arc mirror-polished bridge. The complex differential is the key element in the double regulator system: the rates are averaged out by the mechanism, which drives the blued hour and minute hands of the white stretched-lacquer sub dial. To make things just a bit more complicated, the two flying balances and their escapements are identical mirror images, right down to the position of the stud holders pinning their balance springs.",

Located at 7 o’clock, the hours and minutes are indicated by a pair of serpentine hands on a subdial inclined at 50°, visible only by the wearer; an intimate communication that highlights the personal nature of the LM FlyingT. This powerful articulation of feminine horology, the first of its kind from MB&F, was awarded the Prix de la Complication pour Dame at the 2019 Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève.                         Legacy Machine FlyingT was first launched in 2019 in three editions, all in white gold and set with diamonds: black lacquer dial plate with case set with brilliant-cut diamonds; dial plate and case both fully set with brilliant-cut diamonds; and dial plate and case both fully set with baguette-cut diamonds.New editions have been added since: in diamond-set cases with gemstone dial plates in lapis lazuli, malachite, tiger eye and Coeur de Rubis; and in 18K rose gold or platinum cases, shedding their diamonds but featuring guilloche dial plates.",

A widely grinning “mouth” revealing the occasional bright flicker of the signature MB&F battle-axe rotor. A glistening “skin” of titanium, red gold or exotic zirconium... HM3 Frog may have been small as a specimen of amphibious pond life, but it was mighty on the wrist as it leapt to iconic status at the crossroads of kinetic art and horology.10 years after its debut, HM3 Frog makes its comeback with three ‘FrogX’ anniversary editions: radiantly exposed in a full sapphire crystal case, yet still with a hidden message to be discovered.",Limited edition of 10 pieces

Up forward, two spheres rotate vertically respectively displaying hours and minutes.

Rather than expecting to receive, we conceived the HMX – “X” as in the Roman numeral for ten – as a thank you to the Friends who have supported us over the last 10 years. Instead of developing an ultra-complicated, ultra-expensive anniversary timepiece – standard practice in the luxury world – we cut margins without sacrificing quality, offering a true Horological Machine at an unprecedented price.Designed like a supercar, HMX is a driver’s watch with bi-directional jumping hours and trailing minutes – but it's how and where the time is displayed that makes HMX so special: rotating discs on top of the movement are reflected vertically and magnified by optical prisms. Visible through a curved sapphire crystal, the movement is designed like a supercar engine, down to the dual ""rocker covers"" including shiny oil filler caps.",Limited edition of 20 pieces

247 components / 30 jewels", Minutes and bi-directional jumping hours displayed by two optical prisms that both reflect and magnify.,"Over the last decade, two indelible forms have dominated the main characteristics of an MB&F Horological Machine: the distinctive angular form and optical prism manifested in HM5 and HMX; and the signature battle-axe winding rotor, which took centre stage on top of HM3, MB&F's most popular model to date. 						HM8 takes those two idiosyncratic features and infuses them with high-octane Can-Am race car-inspired design.HM8 features a curvaceous yet angular case with dual optical prisms vertically displaying bi-directional jumping hours and minutes, while the distinctive battle-axe winding rotor is visible on top. But the real star of HM8 is its Can-Am inspired chrome ""roll bars"" majestically sweeping from the top of the front of the Machine down to the tapered back.HM8's Engine sits in full view under nearly invisible sapphire crystal engine cover. The open centre of the battle-axe rotor enables appreciation of the circular wave finish on the movement, while the hours and minute indication discs are visible day and night in the corners.",

22k gold battle-axe automatic winding rotor.
247 components / 30 jewels", Minutes and bi-directional jumping hours displayed by two optical prisms that both reflect and magnify.,"Over the last decade, two indelible forms have dominated the main characteristics of an MB&F Horological Machine: the distinctive angular form and optical prism manifested in HM5 and HMX; and the signature battle-axe winding rotor, which took centre stage on top of HM3, MB&F's most popular model to date. 						HM8 takes those two idiosyncratic features and infuses them with high-octane Can-Am race car-inspired design.HM8 features a curvaceous yet angular case with dual optical prisms vertically displaying bi-directional jumping hours and minutes, while the distinctive battle-axe winding rotor is visible on top. But the real star of HM8 is its Can-Am inspired chrome ""roll bars"" majestically sweeping from the top of the front of the Machine down to the tapered back.HM8's Engine sits in full view under nearly invisible sapphire crystal engine cover. The open centre of the battle-axe rotor enables appreciation of the circular wave finish on the movement, while the hours and minute indication discs are visible day and night in the corners.",

Each of these iterations is linked by its instantly recognizable speedometer-style display on the side of the case that recalls the daring and futuristic design of the 1970s.A decade after the first automotive-inspired MB&F Machines, get ready for the silk-covered reveal of the latest HM8 Mark 2, the most technologically evolved model to date.The HM8 Mark 2 takes the best features of its predecessors and fuses them into a very different Machine. From HM5, it takes the external bodywork’s very apparent supercar styling; from HMX, the ergonomic, compact size; and from HM8, the visible mechanics and very “kinetic” nature, with its dial-side winding rotor. Place all this within an aerodynamic sandwich of CarbonMacrolon, grade 5 titanium and hyper-complex sapphire crystal, and you get a true supercar for the wrist. Like its predecessors, the HM8 Mark 2 is powered by a unique combination of mechanical and optical engineering: the automatic movement’s hour and minute discs, which lie horizontally, are optically magnified and projected 90 degrees to the vertical display thanks to high-precision prisms crafted in sapphire crystal.",Limited edition of 33 pieces

Number of components: 247 components
Number of jewels: 30 jewels"," Bi-directional jumping hours and trailing minutes, displayed by dual reflective sapphire crystal prisms with integrated magnifying lens.","MB&F’s connection to cars runs deep, starting in 2012 with the HM5, followed by the HMX in 2015, and the HM8 in 2016. Each of these iterations is linked by its instantly recognizable speedometer-style display on the side of the case that recalls the daring and futuristic design of the 1970s.A decade after the first automotive-inspired MB&F Machines, get ready for the silk-covered reveal of the latest HM8 Mark 2, the most technologically evolved model to date.The HM8 Mark 2 takes the best features of its predecessors and fuses them into a very different Machine. From HM5, it takes the external bodywork’s very apparent supercar styling; from HMX, the ergonomic, compact size; and from HM8, the visible mechanics and very “kinetic” nature, with its dial-side winding rotor. Place all this within an aerodynamic sandwich of CarbonMacrolon, grade 5 titanium and hyper-complex sapphire crystal, and you get a true supercar for the wrist. Like its predecessors, the HM8 Mark 2 is powered by a unique combination of mechanical and optical engineering: the automatic movement’s hour and minute discs, which lie horizontally, are optically magnified and projected 90 degrees to the vertical display thanks to high-precision prisms crafted in sapphire crystal.",
