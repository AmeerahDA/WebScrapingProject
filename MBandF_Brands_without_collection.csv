Baptised the H. Moser X MB&F Streamliner Pandamonium, it features a minute repeater complication led by a miniature DJing panda, a creature that has become the signature of the Only Watch creations by MB&F.At the heart of the Streamliner's case is a three-dimensional movement that has been developed specifically and exclusively for Only Watch. It will not be used in any other models. Acoustically captivating and visually enticing, the minute repeater mechanism can be seen on the fumé dial in a brand-new colourway. Stripped of logos and indices, this dial illustrates the minimalist philosophy of H. Moser & Cie. and showcases the large suspended balance wheel characteristic of MB&F. With this creation, MB&F and H. Moser & Cie. deliver a masterful mix of their DNAs, rhythmically punctuated with signature elements from each of the two brands. With its rare poetic sophistication, this watch is the height of technical excellence."",";

Alain Silberstein is widely known for his bold use of colour and pattern – and one might have expected the adventurous MB&F to push that tendency to the limit. But no, the two came up with what they affectionately called the “black box”, all Bauhaus purity and restraint. It is crafted like a jewel, but Silberstein says that it reminds him of the miniature box cameras of the 1940s.In terms of design, the Silberstein case retains the twin porthole dials and powerful profile of the original Horological Machine No.2 with its flying-buttress lugs. But otherwise, it has been entirely rethought and rebuilt. The science-fiction shock of the original has given way to something lighter and more whimsical, with a personality all its own."",";

And it has no hope of escaping, because the complicated movement is wrapped in barbed wire. This emotionally charged piece, a one-of-a-kind interpretation of MB&F’s Horological Machine No.2, is signed by the American artist Sage Vaughn.After a first meeting with Max Büsser, Sage Vaughn understood the mission at once and immediately proposed to donate his time and talent. The entire upper face of the watch is crafted in sapphire crystal, revealing the HM2’s complex engine. The hundreds of minute components are imprisoned in barbed wire and the blue butterfly struggles to escape from the same fate. The scene has all the emotional power of the first rough by Sage Vaughn – a pencil sketch of the movement criss-crossed by barbed wire drawn in red pencil."",";
